RAG Application
Overview
This is a Django-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed for querying and interacting with PDF documents. It uses LangChain for orchestration, Hugging Face embeddings (e.g., 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model) for vectorizing content, and likely integrates tools like FAISS for vector search and PyPDF for PDF parsing. The app allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions, retrieving relevant information augmented by AI models.
The project structure follows a standard Django layout, with a main project folder (myproject) and a custom app (docai) handling the core RAG logic.
Folder Structure
Below is a description of the key folders and files in the repository. This helps anyone understand the project's organization:

myproject/: The root Django project directory. This contains the core configuration files for the entire application.

manage.py: The command-line utility for running Django administrative tasks (e.g., runserver, migrate, makemigrations).
myproject/ (inner folder): Holds the project's settings and global configurations.

init.py: Marks this as a Python package.
settings.py: Defines project settings like installed apps, database configuration, middleware, and environment variables (e.g., for API keys).
urls.py: The main URL router for the project, including paths to include app-specific URLs (e.g., include('docai.urls')).
wsgi.py / asgi.py: Entry points for WSGI/ASGI servers (for deployment).


docai/: The custom Django app containing the RAG-specific logic for document processing and AI queries.

init.py: Marks this as a Python package.
admin.py: (If present) Registers models for the Django admin interface.
apps.py: Configuration for the app (e.g., DocaiConfig).
models.py: Defines database models (e.g., for storing document metadata if used).
tests.py: Unit tests for the app.
views.py: Core views for handling HTTP requests, including PDF upload, embedding generation (using HuggingFaceEmbeddings), and query processing.
urls.py: App-specific URL patterns (e.g., routes for the query interface).
migrations/: Folder for database migration files generated by Django (e.g., 0001_initial.py).
templates/ (optional): HTML templates for rendering pages (e.g., upload form or query results).
static/ (optional): Static files like CSS, JS, or images for the frontend.




requirements.txt (recommended, if not present add one): Lists all Python dependencies (e.g., Django, langchain, langchain-huggingface, sentence-transformers, pypdf2, faiss-cpu).
.env (optional, not committed): For storing sensitive info like API keys (e.g., Hugging Face token).
README.md: This file â€“ you're reading it!

If additional folders like media/ (for uploaded files) or db.sqlite3 (default database) are generated during setup, they will appear in the root.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.11 recommended for compatibility).
Git for cloning the repository.
Optional: Anaconda or virtualenv for environment management.
Access to Hugging Face models (free account for API token if needed).

Installation Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/httpdivyansh/RAG-Application.git
cd RAG-Application
(Note: If the repo appears empty on GitHub, ensure you have the latest local changes pushed.)
Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended to isolate dependencies):
python -m venv venv

Activate it:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate




Install Dependencies:
If requirements.txt exists:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If not, install core packages manually:
pip install django langchain langchain-huggingface sentence-transformers transformers pypdf2 faiss-cpu torch
(Add torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 for GPU support if available.)
Set Up Environment Variables (if required):
Create a .env file in the root:
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token (optional for some models)
Load it in settings.py using python-dotenv (install if needed: pip install python-dotenv).
Apply Database Migrations (if models are defined):
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Running the Project

Start the Development Server:
python manage.py runserver

The app will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the port specified).
Access the RAG interface (likely at / or a specific path defined in urls.py).


Usage:

Upload a PDF via the web interface (assuming a form in views).
Ask questions in the query box; the app will use embeddings to retrieve and generate responses.
For testing: Ensure embeddings load correctly in docai/views.py.



Troubleshooting

Embedding Errors: If you encounter TensorFlow DLL issues, uninstall TensorFlow (pip uninstall tensorflow) as the app can use PyTorch backend. Reinstall sentence-transformers if needed.
Missing Modules: Run pip freeze > requirements.txt after a successful install to capture all deps.
Database Issues: By default, uses SQLite; configure settings.py for PostgreSQL/MySQL if needed.
For production: Use a server like Gunicorn + Nginx, and set DEBUG=False in settings.

Contributing
Feel free to fork, submit issues, or pull requests. Ensure tests pass and follow PEP8 style.
